# My thougtprocess:
# 1. Set left and right borders
# 2. if sum of left and right is equal we have the suolution
# 3. if sum of left and right is less than target, we need to increase left
# 4. if sum of left and right is greater than target, we need to decrease right
# 5. continue until solution is found or left is greater than right
# 6. Because there is a solution, we donÂ´t need the last return, but it is good to have it
