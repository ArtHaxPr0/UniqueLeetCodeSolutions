## UniqueLeetCodeSolutions

This repository contains my unique solutions to various LeetCode questions. Each solution showcases my thought process and personal implementation approach. While these solutions may not always be optimal, they offer a distinctive perspective.

### Language Coverage

I plan to solve every question in both Python and C++. While it is not necessary for learning purposes, I aim to improve my STL (Standard Template Library) skills in C++ as it offers a wide range of features.

## Imports

To Access and view those imports Press on the Language you want to see. [Python](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1268235/imported-python-modules-in-the-solution-template). 
For C++ i couldnÂ´t finde the complete list, but I will append the needed ressources while creating the solutions.

## NeetCode as Roadmap

The folder structure in this repository represents different paths that can be taken on the NeetCode.io roadmap. NeetCode.io is a website that provides a curated collection of the 150 most important LeetCode questions. I highly recommend checking out the website for additional resources and practice.
